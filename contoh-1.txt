Auto switch based on OS color scheme#
Windows and macOS support light and dark color schemes. There is a setting, window.autoDetectColorScheme, that instructs VS Code to listen to changes to the OS's color scheme and switch to a matching theme accordingly.

To customize the themes that are used when a color scheme changes, you can set the preferred light, dark, and high contrast themes with the settings:

workbench.preferredLightColorTheme - defaults to "Default Light+"
workbench.preferredDarkColorTheme - defaults to "Default Dark+"
workbench.preferredHighContrastColorTheme - defaults to "Default High Contrast"
